      <p id="aboutMeParagraph">
        I am currently a junior attending Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania with a GPA
        of 3.606 and a graduation date of May 2025. I am very passionate about coding
        creative solutions to complex problems and am eager to learn more!
        <br><br>
        Also, I am the first in my family to be born in the United States! I am family oriented
        and cherish my time spent with them. Additionally, I have a passion for athletics and
        enjoy engaging in outdoor activities such as fishing. And of course, I have a keen
        interest in technology.
